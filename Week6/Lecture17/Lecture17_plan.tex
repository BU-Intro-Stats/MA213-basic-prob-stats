\begin{itemize}
    % ---------- From Lecture 16 ----------
    \item xx min R demonstration: superimpose Normal on simulated sampling dist, show approximation for varying N 
    \item xx min Lecture: CLT # TODO add CLT for sample mean (unknown population distribution Stress that n is large enough, will revisit in Chapter 7)
    \item xx min lecture: Wrap up CLT

    % ---------- New for Lecture 17 ----------
    \item xx min Lecture: Motivate CIs
    \item xx min Lecture: Facebook example
    \item xx min R demonstration: simulate running the experiment many times, get different answers for the CI, 95\% contain true
    \item xx min Edfinity quiz (confidence level)
    \item xx min R demonstration: effect of confidence level
    \item xx min lecture: Wrap up confidence intervals
\end{itemize}
