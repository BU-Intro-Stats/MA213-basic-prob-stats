    \begin{itemize}
        % ---------- From Lecture 8 ----------
        \item 8 min Lecture (5 frames): Expectation and variability
        \item 8 min R Demo: Interpreting theoretical mean and variance (sample the card game RV, make a histogram of the samples, compare it to the discrete distribution, compute mean and variance of the samples, compare them to the theoretical mean and variance)
        \item 5 min Lecture (4 frames): Linear combinations
        \item 5 min Edfinity quiz: Linear combinations

        % ---------- New for Lecture 9 ----------
        \item 10 min Lecture(5 frames): RVs recap
        \item 8 min Pair work: Derive mean and SD of the sample mean (give hints every 2 minutes)
        % Hints:
        % 1. Write out the definition of the sample mean, identify random variables vs constants
        % 1b. Write down rules for linear combinations
        % 2. E[Xbar] = E[1/n(X_1 + ... + X_n)] 
        % 3. = 1/n(E[X_1] + ... + E[X_n])
        % 4. = 1/n(n * mu) = mu
        % 5. Var(Xbar) = Var(1/n(X_1 + ... + X_n)) 
        % 6. = 1/n^2 (Var(X_1) + ... + Var(X_n))
        % 7. = 1/n^2(n * sigma^2) = sigma^2/n
        % 8. SD(Xbar) = sqrt(Var(Xbar)) = sigma/sqrt(n)
        \item 6 min Board work: Derive mean and SD of the sample mean
        
        % ---------- ok if we don't get to this ----------
        \item 5 min Lecture (4 frames): Continuous distributions, probability density functions
        \item xx min R Demonstration: Continuous distribution examples
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: concepts
    \end{itemize}
