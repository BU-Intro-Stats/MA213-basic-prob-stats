# Basic Statistics and Probability

## L3: Simulation and Probability

In this lab session, we will go over random variables and compute the expectation and variance of random variables and their linear combinations. We will verify whether the theory holds using R.

## Pre-lab activities

Let's think about

-   What are the outcome and random variable in this case?

-   What is the expectation?

## Q) Let’s roll a die! You are playing a dice-rolling game and you’re curious about how this game goes at the end. The rule is you roll it once and other player roll it once and add the outcome. How this game goes at the end? In other words, what is the expectation and variance?

We need three people. Two people roll the dice each time and the other person record each turn.

| i        | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| person 1 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| person 2 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| outcome  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Then, what is $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$? How do you obtain from this simulation study?

## Lab activities

Let's consider if we want to do $i=1, ..., 1000$ . How do you want to do it?

1.  Rolling dice part
2.  Record each run
3.  Calculation at the end

### How do you roll each run using R?

Sample function —

### Random Samples and Permutations

#### Description

`sample` takes a sample of the specified size from the elements of `x` using either with or without replacement.

#### Usage

```         
sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
```

#### Arguments

|  |  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `x` | either a vector of one or more elements from which to choose, or a positive integer. See ‘Details.’ |
| `n` | a positive number, the number of items to choose from. See ‘Details.’ |
| `size` | a non-negative integer giving the number of items to choose. |
| `replace` | should sampling be with replacement? |
| `prob` | a vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements of the vector being sampled. |

Let's roll one dice and show the output.

```{r}




```

## Loops

`for` loops are used to iterate operations over items in a vector.

The basic syntax is of the form:

``` r
for (item in vector) {
  perform_action
}
```

For example, if you want to print 1 to 10 each iteration.

```{r}



```

### Using `for loop`, assign outcome of two dice rolled into `myoutcome` from 1000 iterations.

```{r}




```

Calculate probability of each outcome.

```{r}


```

Calculate the simulated expected value of the random variable.

```{r}


```

Calculate the simulated variance of the random variable.

```{r}


```

Make a function that has an input `n` and a list of output that gives you the simulated expected value and variance.

```{r}



```

### Post-lab activities

Please name your submission as `lab3.R`

This time, you invented another challenging game now. If one person roll a dice, then the value is multiplied by 3. Also when second person roll a dice, then the value is multiplied by 4. The final outcome is the sum of those values. What is the expected value and variance of the random variable? Can you think about it from the theory? Can you verify it using simulation through R?

Calculate theoretical value of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. Assign them into `mu` and `sigma_2`, respectively.

You are going to make an function named `my_sim` which takes input of `n`.

(Gradescope will test with $n=10, 50$ and $100$ ).
