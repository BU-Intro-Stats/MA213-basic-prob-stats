\section*{Final Project Overview}

In the final project, you will produce a written report of a Statistical Data Analysis using topics you learned in this course.  
The report should be 10--15 pages (11pt font, 1.5 or single-spaced, standard margins), including tables and figures.  
You can choose the study question, which may cover various fields such as social science, medicine, sports, natural science, etc.  
You may use datasets of your interest (please cite them correctly).  
Therefore, finding a good data source and an interesting question is crucial.  
You will work in groups of four people on this project.

\subsection*{Suggested Outline}

The following is a suggested outline for your final report:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Title and Abstract:} Include a title and a brief abstract (100--200 words) summarizing the project goals, process, and conclusions.  
    \item \textbf{Introduction:} Describe the motivation, objectives, and hypotheses of your project.  
    \item \textbf{Methods:} Explain the problem and dataset, including data collection details.  
    \item \textbf{Results:} Present your analysis steps and key findings with clear statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, confidence intervals).  
    \item \textbf{Discussion:} Reflect on your results, limitations, and possible future work.  
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Summarize main findings and their significance.  
    \item \textbf{Supplement:} Include R code, extra figures, and tables (no page limit).  
    \item \textbf{References:} Provide cited sources with proper referencing.  
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Deliverable 1: Project outline (due next Friday)  
    \item Deliverable 2: Project progress report slides + R code 
    \item Deliverable 3: Final project report  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Possible examples of the project}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparing the proportion of smokers across different age groups  
    \item Testing the association between gender and preference for a product (two-proportion test)  
    \item Hypothesis testing on the effect of a new drug on patient recovery rates  
    \item Comparing pass rates between two different teaching methods  
\end{itemize}
