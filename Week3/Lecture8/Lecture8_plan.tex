    \begin{itemize}
        \item 6 min Lecture (5 frames): Sampling from a small population
        \item 4 min Edfinity Quiz: Sampling with/without replacement
        % \item 4 min R Demonstration: Sampling with and without replacement in R (use it for a LLN refresher demo?)
        \item 4 min Lecture (3 frames): Random variables and Discrete probability distributions
        \item 4 min Edfinity Quiz: (3 multiple choice subquestions: Identifying Discrete Probability Distributions as Table, Bar plot, Formula)
        \item 8 min Lecture + Board work (4 frames): Expectation and variability
        \item 5 min Edfinity Quiz: computing expectation and Variance
        \item 4 min Board work: Quiz solutions
        \item 8 min R Demo: Interpreting theoretical mean and variance (sample the card game RV, make a histogram of the samples, compare it to the discrete distribution, compute mean and variance of the samples, compare them to the theoretical mean and variance)
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): Linear combinations
        \item 3 min Edfinity quiz: Linear combinations
   \end{itemize}
