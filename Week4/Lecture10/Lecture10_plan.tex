% TODO: Fill in planned durations
% TODO: R demo on normal distribution
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on z scores and percentiles, using a table
% TODO: Make a slide for the Quality Control example that shows how to get the probability with a table
% TODO: R demo on computing probabilities with R
% TODO: Edfinity quiz / board work on cutoff points / geometric logic with the normal distribution (using symmetry and 1-x to compute probabilities using logic)
