Please write the names of all your team members, INCLUDING YOURSELF, and rate the degree
to which each member fulfilled his/her responsibilities in completing the group assignments.
Use the following rating system:


\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label=\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{Excellent}: Outstanding contribution, extra effort, and leadership.
    \item \textbf{Satisfactory}: Completed responsibilities adequately, met expectations.
    \item \textbf{Unsatisfactory}: Frequently missed or did incomplete work, did not meet expectations.
    \item \textbf{Failing}: Had no participation at all. No effort was made to attend meetings or complete responsibilities.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

These ratings should reflect each individual's level of participation and effort and sense of responsibility, not his or her academic ability.
