\subsection{Transforming data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Extremely skewed data}

When data are extremely skewed, transforming them might make modeling easier. A common transformation is the \hl{log transformation}.

$\:$ \\
\pause
The histogram on the left shows the distribution of number of basketball games attended by students. The histogram on the right shows the distribution of the natural log of number of games attended \hl{plus 1} (Can you think of why?).

\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{\chpii@path/2-1_numerical_data/figures/basket_games/basket_games_hist_log}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Pros and cons of transformations}

\begin{itemize}

\item Skewed data are easier to model with when they are transformed because outliers tend to become far less prominent after an appropriate transformation. \\
$\:$ \\
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r }
\# of games		&  70 	& 50 		& 25 		 		& $\cdots$ \\
log(\# of games)	& 4.25	& 3.91 	& 3.22 	 	& $\cdots$
\end{tabular}

$\:$ \\

\item However, results of an analysis in log units of the measured variable might be difficult to interpret.
\item Also, transformations can cause their own problems (e.g. what happens to the log transform for 0 games?)

\end{itemize}

\section{Considering categorical data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Contingency tables and bar plots}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Contingency tables}

A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables is called a \hl{contingency table}.

$\:$ \\
\pause
The contingency table below shows the distribution of survival and ages of passengers on the Titanic.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l cc r}
					               & 			 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{{Survival}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
					               &			 & Died	 & Survived	& Total \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{{Age}}& Adult & 1438  & 654 	  	& 2092 \\ 
  					             & Child & 52 	 & 57	 	    & 109\\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  					             & Total & 1490  & 711	    &  2201 \\
  \cline{2-5}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bar plots}

A \hl{bar plot} is a common way to display a single categorical variable. A bar plot where proportions instead of frequencies are shown is called a \hl{relative frequency bar plot}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{\chpii@path/2-2_categorical_data/figures/titanic_age_survival/titanic_bar}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{\chpii@path/2-2_categorical_data/figures/titanic_age_survival/titanic_rel_bar}
\end{center}

\pause

\dq{How are bar plots different than histograms?}

\soln{\pause{{\tiny Bar plots are used for displaying distributions of categorical variables,  histograms are used for numerical variables. The x-axis in a histogram is a number line,  hence the order of the bars cannot be changed. In a bar plot, the categories can be listed in any order (though some orderings make more sense than others, especially for ordinal variables.)}}}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Row and column proportions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Choosing the appropriate proportion}

\dq{Does there appear to be a relationship between age and survival for passengers on the Titanic?}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l cc r}
					               & 			 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{{Survival}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
					               &			 & Died	 & Survived	& Total \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{{Age}}& Adult & 1438  & 654 	  	& 2092 \\ 
  					             & Child & 52 	 & 57	 	    & 109\\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  					             & Total & 1490  & 711	    &  2201 \\
  \cline{2-5}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause

To answer this question we examine the row proportions: 

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item \% Adults who survived: 654 / 2092 $\approx 0.31$ \\

\pause

\item \% Children who survived: 57 / 109 $\approx 0.52$ \\

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Gender discrimination}

\begin{itemize}

\item In 1972, as a part of a study on gender discrimination, 48 male bank supervisors were each given the same personnel file and asked to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager job that was described as ``routine". 

\item The files were identical except that half of the supervisors had files showing the person was male while the other half had files showing the person was female.

\item It was randomly determined which supervisors got ``male" applications and which got ``female" applications.  

\item Of the 48 files reviewed, 35 were promoted. 

\item The study is testing whether females are unfairly discriminated against.  
\end{itemize}

% \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

% \item If we were to repeat the experiment we will definitely see that more female files get promoted. This was a fluke.

% \item Promotion is dependent on gender, males are more likely to be promoted, and hence there is gender discrimination against women in promotion decisions. \soln{\only<2>{\red{Maybe}}}

% \item The difference in the proportions of promoted male and female files is due to chance, this is not evidence of gender discrimination against women in promotion decisions. \soln{\only<2>{\red{Maybe}}}

% \item Women are less qualified than men, and this is why fewer females get promoted.

\begin{itemize}
\item If they were very unlikely to have occurred, then the evidence raises more than a reasonable doubt in our minds about the null hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

\item Ultimately we must make a decision. How unlikely is unlikely?

\begin{itemize}

\item If the evidence is not strong enough to reject the assumption of innocence, the jury returns with a verdict of ``not guilty".
\begin{itemize}
\item The jury does not say that the defendant is innocent, just that there is not enough evidence to convict.
\item The defendant may, in fact, be innocent, but the jury has no way of being sure.
\end{itemize}

\item Said statistically, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
\begin{itemize}
\item We never declare the null hypothesis to be true, because we simply do not know whether it's true or not.
\item Therefore we never ``accept the null hypothesis".

\frametitle{A trial as a hypothesis test (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}

\item In a trial, the burden of proof is on the prosecution.

\item In a hypothesis test, the burden of proof is on the unusual claim.

\item The null hypothesis is the ordinary state of affairs (the status quo), so it's the alternative hypothesis that we consider unusual and for which we must gather evidence.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recap: hypothesis testing framework}

\begin{itemize}
\item We start with a \hl{null hypothesis ($H_0$)} that represents the status quo.
\item We also have an \hl{alternative hypothesis ($H_A$)} that represents our research question, i.e. what we're testing for.
\item We conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, either via simulation (today) or theoretical methods (later in the course).
\item If the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, we stick with the null hypothesis. If they do, then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

If results from the simulations based on the \hl{chance model} look like the data, then we can determine that the difference between the proportions of promoted files between males and females was simply \hl{due to chance} (promotion and gender are independent). \\

If the results from the simulations based on the chance model do not look like the data, then we can determine that the difference between the proportions of promoted files between males and females was not due to chance, but \hl{due to an actual effect of gender} (promotion and gender are dependent).

% \item Shuffle the cards and deal them intro two groups of size 24, representing males and females. 
% \item Count and record how many files in each group are promoted (number cards).

% \item Calculate the proportion of promoted files in each group and take the difference (male - female), and record this value.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item No, the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, therefore we can't reject the null hypothesis of independence between gender and promotion decisions. The observed difference between the two proportions was due to chance.
\solnMult{Yes, the data provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis of gender discrimination against women in promotion decisions. The observed difference between the two proportions was due to a real effect of gender.}
