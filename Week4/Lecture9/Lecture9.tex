\frametitle{Random variables}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \hl{random variable} is a numeric quantity whose value depends on the outcome of a random event
\begin{itemize}
\item We use a capital letter, like $X$, to denote a random variable
\item The values of a random variable are denoted with a lowercase letter, in this case $x$
\item For example, $P(X = x)$
\end{itemize}

\item There are two types of random variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Discrete random variables} often take only integer values
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Number of credit hours, Difference in number of credit hours this term vs last
\end{itemize}
\item \hl{Continuous random variables} take real (decimal) values
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Cost of books this term, Difference in cost of books this term vs last
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Distribution of a discrete random variable}

\dq{In a game of cards you win \$1 if you draw a heart, \$5 if you draw an ace (including the ace of hearts), \$10 if you draw the king of spades and nothing for any other card you draw. Write the probability model for your winnings, and calculate your expected winning.}

Event		& $X$ 		& $P(X)$        		 \\

Heart (not ace)	& $1$		& $\frac{12}{52}$	 \\
Ace			& $5$		& $\frac{4}{52}$	 \\

The distribution of a discrete random variable is also called a \hl{probability mass function} or \hl{PMF}.

\subsection{Expectation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Expectation}

\begin{itemize}

\item We are often interested in the average outcome of a random variable.

\item We call this the \hl{expected value} (mean), and it is a weighted average of the possible outcomes
\formula{\[\mu = E(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^k x_i ~ P(X = x_i)\]}
Here, the $x_i$'s are the possible values of the random variable, and the weights are the probabilities of each value.
\pause
\begin{small}
\item Compare this to the formula for the sample mean of a dataset:
\formula{\[\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i\]}
Here, the $x_i$'s are the observed data points, and each point is weighted equally ($\frac{1}{n}$).
\end{small}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Variability in random variables}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variability}

We are also often interested in the variability in the values of a random variable. We call this the \hl{variance}

\formula{
\[ \sigma^2 = Var(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^k (x_i - E(X))^2 P(X = x_i) \]
\[ \sigma = SD(X) = \sqrt{Var(X)} \]
}
Again, the $x_i$'s are the possible values of the random variable, and the weights are the probabilities of each value.

\pause
\begin{small}
Compare this to the formula for the sample variance of a dataset:
\formula{\[ s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \]}
Again, the $x_i$'s are the observed data points, and each point is weighted (approximately) equally ($\frac{1}{n-1}$).
\end{small}

\frametitle{Linear combinations}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \hl{linear combination} of random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by

\[ aX + bY + c\]

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are some fixed numbers (\hl{constants}).

\pause

\item The average value of a linear combination of random variables is given by
\formula{\[ E(aX + bY + c) = a \times E(X) + b \times E(Y) + c\]}

\begin{align*} 
E(5S+25P) &= 5 \times E(S) + 25 \times E(P) \\

\subsection{Variability in linear combinations of random variables}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Linear combinations}

\begin{itemize}

\item The variability of a linear combination of two \hl{independent} random variables is calculated as
\formula{\[ V(aX + bY + c) = a^2 \times V(X) + b^2 \times V(Y) \]}

\pause 

\item The standard deviation of the linear combination is the square root of the variance.

\end{itemize}

\Note{If the random variables are not independent, the variance calculation gets a little more complicated and is beyond the scope of this course.}

\dq{The standard deviation of the number of statistics problems per homework is 2.3 problems, and it is 0.5 problems for physics homeworks.
