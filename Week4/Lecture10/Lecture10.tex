\frametitle{Continuous distributions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Below is a histogram of the distribution of heights of US adults. 

\item The proportion of data that falls in the shaded bins gives the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm (about 5'11" to 6'1").

\end{itemize}

\subsection{From histograms to continuous distributions}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{From histograms to continuous distributions}

Since height is a continuous numerical variable, its \hl{probability density function} is a smooth curve.

\subsection{Probabilities from continuous distributions}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Probabilities from continuous distributions}

Therefore, the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm can also be estimated as the shaded area under the curve.

\frametitle{Probabilities from continuous distributions}

How do we compute $P(a<X<b)$, the area under the probability density function $f(x)$ between two points $a$ and $b$?
\begin{itemize}
  \item Approximate it with rectangles
  \item Compute it using calculus: $P(a<X<b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sometimes, we will give you a formula for $P(X<x)$ or similar
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use statistical software 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item e.g. in R, \texttt{pnorm(x)} computes $P(X<x)$ for the Normal distribution
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use a Probability table for $P(X<x)$ or $P(0<X<x)$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{By definition...}

Since continuous probabilities are estimated as ``the area under the curve", the probability of a person being exactly 180 cm (or any exact value) is defined as 0.

\subsection{Standardizing with Z scores}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}

\dq{SAT scores are distributed nearly normally with mean 1500 and standard deviation 300. ACT scores are distributed nearly normally with mean 21 and standard deviation 5. A college admissions officer wants to determine which of the two applicants scored better on their standardized test with respect to the other test takers: Pam, who earned an 1800 on her SAT, or Jim, who scored a 24 on his ACT?}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\chpiv@path/4-1_normal_distribution/figures/satActNormals/satActNormals}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standardizing with Z scores}

Since we cannot just compare these two raw scores, we instead compare how many standard deviations beyond the mean each observation is.

\begin{itemize}

\item Pam's score is $\frac{1800 - 1500}{300} = 1$ standard deviation above the mean.

\item Jim's score is $\frac{24 - 21}{5} = 0.6$ standard deviations above the mean.

\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\chpiv@path/4-1_normal_distribution/figures/satActNormals/satActNormalsStandardized}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standardizing with Z scores (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}

\item These are called \hl{standardized} scores, or \hl{Z scores}.

\item Z score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean.
\formula{\[Z = \frac{observation - mean}{SD}\]}
\pause

\item Z scores are defined for distributions of any shape, but only when the distribution is normal can we use Z scores to calculate percentiles.
\item If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$, then $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0, 1)$.

\pause
\item Observations that are more than 2 SD away from the mean ($|Z| > 2$) are usually considered unusual.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Percentiles}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Percentile} is the percentage of observations that fall below a given data point. 

\item Graphically, percentile is the area below the probability distribution curve to the left of that observation.

\end{itemize}
