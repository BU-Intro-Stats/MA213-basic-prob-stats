\begin{itemize}
    \item xx min Lecture: Reminder of sampling distribution
    \item xx min Lecture: Sampling distribution of the sample mean for Normal populations (reminder from Lecture 9) # TODO
    \item xx min R demonstration: motivate CLT
    \item xx min Board work: Given that the Binomial converges to Normal, derive mean and std error
    \item xx min R demonstration: superimpose Normal on simulated sampling dist, show approximation for varying N
    \item xx min Lecture: CLT # TODO add CLT for sample mean (unknown population distribution Stress that n is large enough, will revisit in Chapter 7)
    \item xx min Edfinity quiz: Checking sample size
    \item xx min lecture: Wrap up CLT
 \end{itemize}

% TODO: Slides to kick off the lecture reminding of sampling distribution with a concrete example
% TODO: board work for mean and variance of normal approximation: use the last page from Lecture 15 notes
% TODO: Cross-reference the R demo in this lecture with the one from Lecture 13, make sure it builds.
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on conditions for CLT
