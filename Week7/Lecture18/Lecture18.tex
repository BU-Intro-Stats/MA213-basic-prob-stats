\frametitle{Facebook's categorization of user interests}

\dq{Most commercial websites (e.g. social media platforms, news outlets, online retailers) collect a data about their users' behaviors and use these data to deliver tageted content, recommendations, and ads. To understand whether Americans think their lives line up with how the algorithm-driven classification systems categorizes them, Pew Research asked a representative sample of 850 American Facebook users how accurately they feel the list of categories Facebook has listed for them on the page of their supposed interests actually represents them and their interests. 67\% of the respondents said that the listed categories were accurate. Estimate the true proportion of American Facebook users who think the Facebook categorizes their interests accurately.}

The approximate 95\% confidence interval is defined as 
\[ point~estimate \pm 1.96 \times SE \]

% \pause

\vspace{-0.3cm}
\[ SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.67 \times 0.33}{850}} \approx 0.016 \]

\frametitle{What does 95\% confident mean?}

"We are 95\% confident that the interval we calculated from our sample (0.64, 0.70) contains the true population proportion."
\pause
\begin{itemize}

\item Suppose we took many samples and built a confidence interval from each sample using the equation $point~estimate \pm 1.96 \times SE$.

\item Then about 95\% of those intervals would contain the true population proportion ($p$).

\subsection{Changing the confidence level}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Changing the confidence level}

\[ point~estimate\pm z^\star \times SE \] 

\begin{itemize}

\item In a confidence interval, $z^\star \times SE$ is called the \hl{margin of error}, and for a given sample, the margin of error changes as the confidence level changes.

\item In order to change the confidence level we need to adjust $z^\star$ in the above formula.

\item Commonly used confidence levels in practice are 90\%, 95\%, 98\%, and 99\%.

\item For a 95\% confidence interval, $z^\star = 1.96$.

\item However, using the standard normal ($z$) distribution, it is possible to find the appropriate $z^\star$ for any confidence level.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpreting confidence intervals}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interpreting confidence intervals}

Confidence intervals are ...

\begin{itemize}

\item always about the population

\item not probability statements 

\item only about population parameters, not individual observations

\item only reliable if the sample statistic they're based on is an unbiased estimator of the population parameter

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Remember when...}

Gender discrimination experiment:

{\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{ll  cc c} 
  		&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Promotion}} \\
\cline{3-4}
							&			& Promoted	& Not Promoted 	& Total	\\
\cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{Gender	}}	&Male 		& 21	 	& 3		& 24 	\\
							&Female		& 14	 	& 10 	 	& 24 \\
\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 35		& 13		& 48 \\
\end{tabular}
}

\pause

\[ \hat{p}_{males} = 21 / 24 \approx 0.88 ~ \text{ and } ~ \hat{p}_{females} = 14 / 24 \approx 0.58 \]

\pause

Possible explanations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Promotion and gender are \hl{independent}, no gender discrimination, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. $\rightarrow$ \orange{null} - {\small (nothing is going on)}
\item Promotion and gender are \hl{dependent}, there is gender discrimination, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. $\rightarrow$ \orange{alternative} - {\small (something is going on)}

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Result}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{\chpv@path/5-3_ht_prop/figures/discRandDotPlot/discRandDotPlot}
\end{center}

\pause

Since it was quite unlikely to obtain results like the actual data or something more extreme in the simulations (male promotions being 30\% or more higher than female promotions), we decided to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recap: hypothesis testing framework}

\begin{itemize}
\item We start with a \hl{null hypothesis ($H_0$)} that represents the status quo.
\pause
\item We also have an \hl{alternative hypothesis ($H_A$)} that represents our research question, i.e. what we're testing for.
\pause
\item We conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, either via simulation or traditional methods based on the central limit theorem (coming up next...).
\pause
\item If the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, we stick with the null hypothesis. If they do, then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.
\end{itemize}
\pause
We'll formally introduce the hypothesis testing framework using an example on testing a claim about a proportion.

\end{frame}

 \subsection{Testing hypotheses using confidence intervals} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Testing hypotheses using confidence intervals}

{\small \dq{Earlier we calculated a 95\% confidence interval for the proporton of American Facebook users who think Facebook categorizes their interests accurately as 64\% to 67\%. Based on this confidence interval, do the data support the hypothesis that majority of American Facebook users think Facebook categorizes their interests accurately.}}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item The associated hypotheses are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$H_0$:] $p = 0.50$: 50\% of American Facebook users think Facebook categorizes their interests accurately
\item[$H_A$:] $p > 0.50$: More than 50\% of American Facebook users think Facebook categorizes their interests accurately
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Null value is not included in the interval $\rightarrow$ reject the null hypothesis.

\pause

\item This is a quick-and-dirty approach for hypothesis testing, but it doesn't tell us the likelihood of certain outcomes under the null hypothesis.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decision errors}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Decision errors}

\begin{itemize}

\item Hypothesis tests are not flawless.

\item In the court system innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free.

\item Similarly, we can make a wrong decision in statistical hypothesis tests as well. 

\item The difference is that we have the tools necessary to quantify how often we make errors in statistics.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Decision errors (cont.)}

There are two competing hypotheses: the null and the alternative. In a hypothesis test, we make a decision about which might be true, but our choice might be incorrect. \\

\pause

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l | c c}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Decision}} \\
& & fail to reject $H_0$ &  reject $H_0$ \\

& $H_0$ true & \onslide<3->{\green{$\checkmark$}} &  \onslide<5->{\orange{Type 1 Error}} \\
\raisebox{1.5ex}{\textbf{Truth}} & $H_A$ true & \onslide<6->{\orange{Type 2 Error}} & \onslide<4->{\green{$\checkmark$}} \\
  \cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item \onslide<5->{A \hl{Type 1 Error} is rejecting the null hypothesis when $H_0$ is true.}

\item \onslide<6->{A \hl{Type 2 Error} is failing to reject the null hypothesis when $H_A$ is true.}

\item \onslide<7->{We (almost) never know if $H_0$ or $H_A$ is true, but we need to consider all possibilities.}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[shrink]
\frametitle{Hypothesis Test as a trial}

If we again think of a hypothesis test as a criminal trial then it makes sense to frame the verdict in terms of the null and alternative hypotheses:
\begin{align*}
H_0&:\text{ Defendant is innocent} \\
H_A&:\text{ Defendant is guilty}
\end{align*}

Which type of error is being committed in the following circumstances?

\begin{itemize}
\item Declaring the defendant innocent when they are actually guilty
\soln{\only<2->{\begin{center}\hl{Type 2 error}\end{center}}}
\item Declaring the defendant guilty when they are actually innocent
\soln{\only<3->{\begin{center}\hl{Type 1 error}\end{center}}}
\end{itemize}

\only<4->{Which error do you think is the worse error to make?}
\only<5>{\begin{center}{\footnotesize ``better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer''\\ -- William Blackstone}\end{center}}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Type 1 error rate}

\begin{itemize}

% \item As a general rule we reject $H_0$ when the p-value is less than 0.05, i.e. we use a \hl{significance level} of 0.05, \mathhl{\alpha = 0.05}.
\item When designing a hypothesis test, we first choose a \hl{significance level}, e.g. \mathhl{\alpha = 0.05}, and we design the hypothesis test so that if $H_0$ is true, we reject it no more than 5\% of the time.

\pause

\item In other words, when using a 5\% significance level there is about 5\% chance of making a Type 1 error if the null hypothesis is true.
\[ \mathhl{ P(\text{Type 1 error} \: | \: \text{$H_0$ true}) = \alpha } \]

\pause

\item This is why we prefer small values of $\alpha$ -- increasing $\alpha$ increases the Type 1 error rate.

\end{itemize}

% \pause

% \item There may be two explanations why our sample proportion is lower than 0.50 (minority).
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The true population proportion is different than 0.50.
% \item The true population mean is 0.50, and the difference between the true population proportion and the sample proportion is simply due to natural sampling variability.
% \end{itemize}

%  \end{itemize}

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Setting the hypotheses}

% \begin{itemize}

% \[ \mathhl{H_0:}~p = 0.50 \]

% \pause

% \item We test the claim that the proportion of American Facebook users who are comfortable with Facebook creating categories of interests for them is different than 50\%

% \pq{Which of the following is \emph{not} a condition that needs to be met to proceed with this hypothesis test?}

% \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
% \item Respondents in the sample should be independent of each other with respect to whether or not they feel comfortable with their interests being categorized by Facebook.
% \item Sampling should have been done randomly.
% \item The sample size should be less than 10\% of the population of all American Facebook users.
