    \begin{itemize}
        % ---------- From Lecture 13 ----------
        \item 4 min Lecture (3 frames): review
        \item 8 min R Demonstration: sampling from Binomial, different parameters, normal approximation
        \item 3 min Lecture (3 frames): Normal approximation
        \item 4 min Edfinity quiz: Modeling with the Binomial random variables
        
        % ---------- New for Lecture 14 ----------
        \item 10 min Lecture (7 frames): Poisson distribution
        \item 3 min R Demonstration: sampling from Poisson, different parameters
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: when does modeling with a Poisson distribution make sense?
        \item xx min (if time) R demo: Relationship between Poisson and Binomial
    \end{itemize}

% TODO: Add figure of an example Poisson pmf to the distribution slide, with mean, +/- 1 std, +/- 2 std
% TODO: R demo for Poisson Sampling
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on using the Poisson
% TODO: (optional) Consider doing the relationship between poisson and binomial as an R demo -- emily has slides on this (Lecture 14 slides 6 and 7)
