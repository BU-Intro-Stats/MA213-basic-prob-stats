\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{M3 LO2: Visualize and Interpret Sampling Distributions:} Draw and interpret sampling distributions for a point estimate (e.g., population proportion) across different sample sizes, explaining how the distribution changes as the sample size increases. 
    \item \textbf{M3 LO3: Calculate and Interpret Standard Error:} Calculate the standard error for proportions and interpret it as a measure of sampling variability. 
\end{itemize}
