    \begin{itemize}
        % ---------- From Lecture 6 ----------
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): independence
        \item 2 min Lecture (3 frames): recap + putting everything together

        % ---------- New for Lecture 7----------
        \item 2 min Edfinity quiz (Independence, complements)
        \item 7 min Lecture (7 frames): Conditional, marginal, and joint probability
        \item 5 min Edfinity quiz (Computing probabilities from a table)
        \item 4 min Lecture (3 frames): General multiplication rule, independence and conditional probabilities
        \item 3 min Edfinity quiz (Checking for independence using the general multiplication rule: one is independent, one isn't)
        \item 4 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz
        
        % ---------- Didn't get to----------       
        \item 5 min Lecture (2 frames): inverting probabilities
        \item 4 min Lecture (2+ frames): Bayes' Theorem and the Law of Total Probability
        \item 6 min Edfinity quiz (2 subquestions: (1) Law of total probability (2) Bayes' Theorem)
        \item 4 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz
