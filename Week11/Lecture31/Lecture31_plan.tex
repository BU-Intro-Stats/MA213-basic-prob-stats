    \begin{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: Motivate linear regression, modeling numerical variables
        \item xx min R Demonstration: scatter plots, response/explanatory variable(s), determining relationships  % like slide 2
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: from scatter plots, practice determining response/explanatory and relationship between variables for different examples
        \item xx min Lecture: residuals, correlation
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: guessing and then assessing correlation (like slides 9-11)
        \item xx min Lecture: motivate line-fitting (next time)

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO1: Classify and Analyze Variables:} Categorize variables based on their types (e.g., numerical/categorical, continuous/discrete, ordinal), assess their association (positive, negative, or independent), and determine which make sense as explanatory vs. response variables.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO4: Visualize and Describe Data Distributions:} Select appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, histograms, box plots, bar plots) to depict data, and describe distributions qualitatively (shape, center, spread, outliers) and quantitatively (mean, median, mode, range, IQR, standard deviation).
        \item \textbf{M5, LO1: Describe and Assess Relationships Between Two Variables:} Describe the association between two numerical variables in a scatter plot in terms of direction, shape (linear or nonlinear), and strength, and assess whether linear regression is an appropriate model.
