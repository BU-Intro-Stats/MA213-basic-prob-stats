\frametitle{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{M1 LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
    \item \textbf{M3 LO2: Visualize and Interpret Sampling Distributions:} Draw and interpret sampling distributions for a point estimate (e.g., population proportion) across different sample sizes, explaining how the distribution changes as the sample size increases. [Q3, L4]     \item \textbf{M6 LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
    \item \textbf{M3 LO3: Calculate and Interpret Standard Error:} Calculate the standard error for proportions and interpret it as a measure of sampling variability. [Q3, L4]

% TODO: Slides to kick off the lecture reminding of sampling distribution with a concrete example
% TODO: board work for mean and variance of normal approximation: use the last page from Lecture 15 notes
% TODO: Cross-reference the R demo in this lecture with the one from Lecture 13, make sure it builds.
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on conditions for CLT
