    \begin{itemize}
        % ------ (From Lecture 3) --------
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): variance, stddev, Q1 Q3 IQR
        \item 8 min R demonstration: Comparing shapes of distributions with different summary statistics (eg. changing variance, etc.)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Highlight: variance/std and IQR
            \item Mean +/- 2 stddev lines above histogram
            \item Box with no whiskers above histogram to visualize quartiles and motivate box plot
         \end{itemize}

         % ------ New material for Lecture 4 --------
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): Box plot and outliers
        \item 8 min R demo: Box plots with whiskers, outliers (similar to R demo from Lecture 3)
        \item 3 min Edfinity quiz: Outliers (coffee example)
        \item 4 min Lecture: Quiz explanation and what to do with outliers
        % \item 5 min Forum brainstorm: what to do with outliers
        % \item 5 min Applet demo: Robust statistics (e.g. mean vs median, IQR vs standard deviation) https://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html
        \item 3 min Lecture (3 frames) Robust Statistics 
        

        % ------ Didn't get to --------
        % \item 3 min Edfinity quiz: Mean >< Median
        % \item 2 min Lecture (3 frames): Transformations
        % \item 8 min Lecture (8 frames): contingency tables
    \end{itemize}
