    \begin{itemize}
        \item xx min: Intro to Exponential distribution (?)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Motivate with a wait time example (neuroscience?)
            \item Show pdf as formula and figure
            \item Formulas for how to compute areas
            \item Edfinity quiz on computing areas
            \item Properties: mean and variance
            \item (optional) board work on memorylessness -- emily has slides on this (Lecture 17 slides 12-14)
            \item R demo: Simulate a poisson process using exponential RVs, then look at the distribution of counts
        \end{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: Poisson distribution
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Probability mass function
            \item Formulas for expectation and variance (the same!)
            \item Variability
        \end{itemize}
        \item xx min R Demonstration: sampling from Poisson, different parameters
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: when does modeling with a Poisson distribution make sense?
        \item xx min Lecture: review quiz answers
        \item xx min (if time) R demo: Relationship between Poisson and Binomial
    \end{itemize}
