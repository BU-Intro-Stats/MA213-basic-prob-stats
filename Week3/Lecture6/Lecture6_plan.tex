    \begin{itemize}
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): Probability, Law of Large Numbers
        \item 3 min Edfinity quiz (quick LLN intuition, e.g. coin flips)
        \item 5 min R demonstration: LLN
        \item 4 min Edfinity quiz (LLN concept check)
        \item 4 min Lecture (2+ frames): disjoint outcomes
        \item 6 min Edfinity quiz: computing probabilities of disjoint and non-disjoint events (several questions)
        \item 4 min Board work: solutions to quiz questions
        \item 5 min Lecture (3 frames): Probability distributions, Sample space, complements
        \item 3 min Edfinity quiz (complements)
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): independence
        \item 5 min Edfinity quiz (checking for independence)
        \item 2 min Lecture (3 frames): recap + putting everything together

% TODO: Design Quiz for computing probabilities of disjoint and non-disjoint events, with several questions (disjoint/non-disjoint on the same scenario). Look into applets. Plan the board work to explain the answers, using venn diagrams
