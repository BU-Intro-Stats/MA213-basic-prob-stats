    \begin{itemize}
        \item 10 min Lecture (5 frames) interspersed with Edfinity: experimental design
        \item 10 min Lecture (11 frames): Plotting data, means
        \item 8 min R demonstration: histograms and central tendency
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  highlight: distribution mean/median/mode, (multi)modality, skewness, outliers
        \end{itemize}
        % \item 5 min Edfinity quiz (what kind of shapes do you expect these data to have...)
        \item 3 min R demonstration: quiz answer(s)
        \item 3 min: Youtube video from Nat Geo (?)
        \item 8 min: Think/pair/share on the Youtube video
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): variance, stddev, Q1 Q3 IQR
        \item 4 min R demonstration: Comparing shapes of distributions with different summary statistics (eg. changing variance, etc.)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Highlight: variance/std and IQR
            \item Mean +/- 2 stddev lines above histogram
            \item Box with no whiskers above histogram to visualize quartiles and motivate box plot
         \end{itemize}
     \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Learning Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO2: Evaluate Study Design and Its Implications:} Identify and explain experimental design choices (observational vs. experimental, sampling methods, blinding, potential biases), and judge whether results can be generalized to a population or used to infer causation. 
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO4: Visualize and Describe Data Distributions:} Select appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, histograms, box plots, bar plots) to depict data, and describe distributions qualitatively (shape, center, spread, outliers) and quantitatively (mean, median, mode, range, IQR, standard deviation).
    \end{itemize}

% TODO: Adapt experimental design slides and integrate with an Edfinity quiz
% TODO: Build R demo 1 with associated Edfinity quiz (look into a shape applet or multiple choice options)
% TODO: Work on flow for incorporating median discussion in lecture before first R demo
% TODO: Build R demo 2 (shorter)
