    \begin{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: Plotting data, means
        \item xx min R demonstration: examples of plots and computations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  highlight: distribution modality, skewness, outliers
        \end{itemize}
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz (what kind of shapes do you expect these data to have...)
        \item xx min R demonstration: quiz answer(s)
        \item xx min Lecture: variance, stddev, median
        \item xx min R demonstration: Comparing shapes of distribution with different summary statistics (eg. changing variance, etc.)
        \item Transformations? Intensity maps?
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO1: Classify and Analyze Variables:} Categorize variables based on their types (e.g., numerical/categorical, continuous/discrete, ordinal), assess their association (positive, negative, or independent), and determine which make sense as explanatory vs. response variables.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO4: Visualize and Describe Data Distributions:} Select appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, histograms, box plots, bar plots) to depict data, and describe distributions qualitatively (shape, center, spread, outliers) and quantitatively (mean, median, mode, range, IQR, standard deviation).
    \end{itemize}
