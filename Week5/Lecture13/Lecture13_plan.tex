% Note this is a very full lecture
% TODO: Add a figure of an example pmf to the final Binomial distribution slide (currently slide 7), with mean and +/- 1 std, +/- 2 std
% TODO: Consider putting birthday problem back in, but not using these slides
% TODO: R demo on sampling from binomial, normal approximation
