    \begin{itemize}
        \item Classify and Analyze Variables: Categorize variables based on their types (e.g., numerical/categorical, continuous/discrete, ordinal), assess their association (positive, negative, or independent), and determine which make sense as explanatory vs. response variables.
        \item Use R for Data Management and Exploration: Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item Visualize and Describe Data Distributions: Select appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, histograms, box plots, bar plots) to depict data, and describe distributions qualitatively (shape, center, spread, outliers) and quantitatively (mean, median, mode, range, IQR, standard deviation).
