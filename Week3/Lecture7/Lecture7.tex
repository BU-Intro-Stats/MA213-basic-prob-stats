\frametitle{Probability distributions}

A \hl{probability distribution} lists all possible events and the probabilities with which they occur.

\begin{itemize}
\item The probability distribution for the gender of one kid:
{\footnotesize 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r | c | c}
Event    & Male		& Female \\
\hline
Probability	& 0.5		& 0.5 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}

\vspace{2em}
\item Rules for probability distributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The events listed must be disjoint
\item Each probability must be between 0 and 1
\item The probabilities must total 1
\end{enumerate}

\[ S = \{0, \orange{at~least~one} \} \]

\item Earlier we saw that if two events are independent, their joint probability is simply the product of their probabilities. If the events are not believed to be independent, the joint probability is calculated slightly differently.

\formula{\[ P(A~and~B) = P(A|B) \times P(B) \]}

\frametitle{Bayes' Theorem: Version 1}

The conditional probability formula we have seen so far is a special case of \hl{Bayes' Theorem}, which lets us switch the conditioning.

\vspace{2mm}
\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} \implies P(A \cap B) = P(B|A)P(A)
\]
\pause
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bayes' Theorem: Version 2}
We often don't know the marginal probability $P(B)$ by itself, so we split the denominator:
\formula{Bayes' Theorem (2):}{
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)}

This trick can be extended to more than two mutually exclusive events $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$ that \hl{partition} the sample space.

% \app{{\footnotesize A common epidemiological model for the spread of diseases is the SIR model, where the population is partitioned into three groups: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. This is a reasonable model for diseases like chickenpox where a single infection usually provides immunity to subsequent infections. Sometimes these diseases can also be difficult to detect. \vspace{2mm} \\
% Imagine a population in the midst of an epidemic where 60\% of the population is considered susceptible, 10\% is infected, and 30\% is recovered. The only test for the disease is accurate 95\% of the time for susceptible individuals, 99\% for infected individuals, but 65\% for recovered individuals. (Note: In this case accurate means returning a negative result for susceptible and recovered individuals and a positive result for infected individuals). \vspace{2mm} \\
% Draw a probability tree to reflect the information given above. If the individual has tested positive, what is the probability that they are actually infected?
