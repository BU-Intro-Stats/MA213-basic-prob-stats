    \begin{itemize}
        \item 20 min Lecture: course overview, syllabus
        \item 5 min Lecture: Case Study
        \item 10 min Think/pair/share (forum): Do the data show a "real" difference between groups? Are the results generalizable?
        \item 5 min Lecture: Big Picture of statistics
        \item 5 min Edfinity "classroom survey" poll to get data for next Lecture, briefly show results / Data basics slides
        \item 1 min Final announcements (Plan for next time, Reading, Edfinity survey, labs/discussions start week 2)
        \item (after class) Edfinity onboarding survey: getting to know the students: experience, interests, goals for the class, group formation
    \end{itemize}
