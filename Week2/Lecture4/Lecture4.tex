\subsection{Variance and standard deviation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variance}

\hl{Variance} is roughly the average squared deviation from the mean.

\formula{
\[ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1} \]
}

\pause

\twocol{0.5}{0.5}
{
\begin{itemize}

\item The sample mean is $\bar{x} = 6.71$, and the sample size is $n = 217$.

$\:$
\onslide<3->{
\[ s^2 = \frac{(5 - 6.71)^2 + (9 - 6.71)^2 + \cdots + (7 - 6.71)^2}{217 - 1} = 4.11~hours^2 \]
}



\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variance (cont.)}

\dq{Why do we use the squared deviation in the calculation of variance?}

\soln{\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item To get rid of negatives so that observations equally distant from the mean are weighed equally.
\item To weigh larger deviations more heavily.
\end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standard deviation}

The \hl{standard deviation} is the square root of the variance, and has the same units as the data

\formula{
\[ s = \sqrt{s^2} \]
}

\pause

\twocol{0.5}{0.5}
{
\begin{itemize}

\item The standard deviation of amount of sleep students get per night can be calculated as:
\[ s = \sqrt{4.11} = 2.03~hours\]

\onslide<3->{\item We can see that all of the data are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.}

\subsection{Box plots, percentiles, and quartiles}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Percentiles}

\hl{Percentiles}: for any (large) set of n measurements (arranged in ascending or descending order), the $p$th percentile is a number such that $p\%$ of the measurements fall below that number and $(100-p)\%$ are equal to or above it.

\hl{Quantiles}: Percentiles expressed in decimal form.  E.g. The .37 quantile is equivalent to the 37th percentile.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Q1, Q3, and IQR}

\begin{itemize}

\item The $25^{th}$ percentile is also called the first quartile, \hl{Q1}.

\item The $50^{th}$ percentile is also called the median.

\item The $75^{th}$ percentile is also called the third quartile, \hl{Q3}.

\item Between Q1 and Q3 is the middle 50\% of the data. The range these data span is called the \hl{interquartile range}, or the \hl{IQR}.
\formula{\[ IQR = Q3 - Q1 \]}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Box plot}

The box in a \hl{box plot} represents the middle 50\% of the data, and the thick line in the box is the median.

\frametitle{Whiskers and outliers}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Whiskers} of a box plot can extend up to $1.5 \times IQR$ away from the quartiles.
\formula{
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{align*} 
\text{max~upper~whisker~reach} &= Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR \\
\text{max~lower~whisker~reach} &= Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR
\end{align*}
}
\pause
\vspace{-0.5cm}
{\small
\begin{align*}
\text{IQR}&: 20 - 10 = 10 \\
\text{max~upper~whisker~reach}&= 20 + 1.5 \times 10 = 35 \\
\text{max~lower~whisker~reach}&= 10 - 1.5 \times 10 = -5
\end{align*}
}

\pause
\vspace{-0.25cm}
\item A potential \hl{outlier} is defined as an observation beyond the maximum reach of the whiskers. It is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Considerations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Are they consistent with the rest of the data, e.g. a ``long tail"?
    \item Are they errors in data collection or entry, or data points from a different population?
    \item How will your analysis be affected by their presence/absence?
  \end{itemize}
  \item Remove?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If they are errors in data collection or entry
    \item If they are from a different population
  \end{itemize}
  \item Keep?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Consider using robust statistics
    \item Consider using transformations e.g. to account for skewness
    \item (Advanced) Consider using a different model for your population

\begin{frame}

Median and IQR are more robust to skewness and outliers than mean and SD. Therefore,

\begin{itemize}
\item for skewed distributions it is often more helpful to use median and IQR to describe the center and spread
\item for symmetric distributions it is often more helpful to use the mean and SD to describe the center and spread
