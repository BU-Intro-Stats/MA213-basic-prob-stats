\frametitle{Lesson Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    % ---------- From Lecture 15 ----------
    \item 2 min Lecture: Reminder of sampling distribution
    \item 5 min R demonstration: quiz answer(s)
    \item 10 min Board work: Derivation of the theoretical sampling distribution, binomial case
    \item 5 min Lecture: set up two different estimators (mean vs median on population with outliers) 
    \item 8 min R demonstration: Comparing different estimators based on sampling distribution 
    \item 2 min Lecture: Wrap up sampling distribution

    % ---------- New for Lecture 16 ----------
    \item 10 min Lecture: Sampling distribution of the sample mean for Normal populations 
    \item xx min R demonstration: superimpose Normal on simulated sampling dist, show approximation for varying N # TODO cross-reference with Lecture 14 Demo 1
    \item xx min Lecture: CLT # TODO add CLT for sample mean (unknown population distribution Stress that n is large enough, will revisit in Chapter 7)
    \item xx min Edfinity quiz: Checking sample size
    \item xx min lecture: Wrap up CLT
 \end{itemize}

% TODO: Slides to kick off the lecture reminding of sampling distribution with a concrete example
% TODO: board work for mean and variance of normal approximation: use the last page from Lecture 15 notes
% TODO: Cross-reference the R demo in this lecture with the one from Lecture 14, make sure it builds.
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on conditions for CLT
