    \begin{itemize}
        \item 7 min Lecture (7 frames): Conditional, marginal, and joint probability
        \item 4 min Edfinity quiz (RVs and probability concept review)
        \item 4 min Lecture (3 frames): General multiplication rule, independence and conditional probabilities
        \item 6 min Edfinity quiz (4 subquestions: Computing probabilities using table and checking for independence using the general multiplication rule: one is independent, one isn't)
        \item 4 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz
        \item 5 min (Lecture +) Board work (2 frames): inverting probabilities (Consider removing the tree diagram slide, doing it on the board)
        \item 4 min Edfinity quiz (1 subquestion: Computing probabilities with multiplication rule and inversion)
        \item 2 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz
        \item 4 min Lecture (2+ frames): Bayes' Theorem
        \item 6 min Edfinity quiz (2 subquestions: (1) Law of total probability (2) Bayes' Theorem)
        \item 4 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M2, LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
        \item \textbf{M2, LO3: Compute Probabilities Using Various Tools:} Use logic, Venn diagrams, and probability rules to compute probabilities for events.
