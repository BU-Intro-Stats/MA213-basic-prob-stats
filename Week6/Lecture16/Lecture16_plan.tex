\frametitle{Lesson Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    % ---------- From Lecture 15 ----------
    \item 2 min Lecture: Reminder of sampling distribution
    \item 5 min R demonstration: quiz answer(s) and preview of binomial for phat
    \item 4 min Lecture: Derivation of the theoretical sampling distribution, binomial case
    \item 3 min Edfinity quiz: mean and variance of phat
    \item 4 min Lecture: properties of phat as an estimator of p (unbiased, SE decreases with n)
    \item 5 min Lecture: set up two different estimators (mean vs median on population with outliers) 
    \item 8 min R demonstration: Comparing different estimators based on sampling distribution 
    \item 2 min Lecture: Wrap up sampling distribution

    % ---------- New for Lecture 16 ----------
    \item 10 min Lecture: Sampling distribution of the sample mean for Normal populations 
    \item 4 min Edfinity quiz: quality of xbar as an estimator of mu
    
    % ------ Didn't get to this ------
    % \item xx min R demonstration: superimpose Normal on simulated sampling dist, show approximation for varying N 
    % \item xx min Lecture: CLT # TODO add CLT for sample mean (unknown population distribution Stress that n is large enough, will revisit in Chapter 7)
    % \item xx min lecture: Wrap up CLT
 \end{itemize}
