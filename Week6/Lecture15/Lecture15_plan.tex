\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{M1 LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
    \item \textbf{M2 LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
    \item \textbf{M3 LO1: Understand Point Estimates and Sampling Variability:} Define a sample statistic (point estimate) for a population parameter, and explain how it varies across different samples. [Q3, L4] 
    \item \textbf{M3 LO2: Visualize and Interpret Sampling Distributions:} Draw and interpret sampling distributions for a point estimate (e.g., population proportion) across different sample sizes, explaining how the distribution changes as the sample size increases. [Q3, L4]     \item \textbf{M6 LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
