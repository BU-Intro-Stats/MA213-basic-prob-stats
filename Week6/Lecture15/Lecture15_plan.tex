\frametitle{Lesson Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    % ---------- From Lecture 14 ----------
    \item 12 min Lecture + Edfinity: review Poisson distribution + quiz, then quiz on probability models.

    % ---------- New for Lecture 15 ----------
    \item 5 min Lecture: Sampling Distributions
    \item 10 min R demonstration: sampling distribution simulation, binomial case
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  highlight: bias, sampling error
    \end{itemize}
    \item 5 min Edfinity quiz (what would happen if...)
    
    % ---------- Didn't get to this ----------
    % \item 5 min R demonstration: quiz answer(s)
    % \item 10 min Board work: Derivation of the theoretical sampling distribution, binomial case
    % \item xx min Lecture: set up two different estimators (mean vs median on population with outliers) 
    % \item xx min R demonstration: Comparing different estimators based on sampling distribution 
    % \item xx min Lecture: Wrap up sampling distribution
\end{itemize}
