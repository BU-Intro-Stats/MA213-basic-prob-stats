    \begin{itemize}
        % ---------- From Lecture 7 ----------
        \item 5 min Lecture (2 frames): inverting probabilities
        \item 4 min Lecture (2+ frames): Bayes' Theorem and the Law of Total Probability
        \item 6 min Edfinity quiz (2 subquestions: (1) Law of total probability (2) Bayes' Theorem)
        \item 4 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz

        % ---------- New for Lecture 8 ----------
        \item 6 min Lecture (5 frames): Sampling from a small population
        \item 4 min Edfinity Quiz: Sampling with/without replacement
        \item 4 min Lecture (3 frames): Random variables and Discrete probability distributions
        \item 4 min Edfinity Quiz: (Matching: Identifying Discrete Probability Distributions as Table, Bar plot, Formula)
        \item 4 min Board work: interpreting the bernoulli formula
        
        % ---------- Didn't get to this ----------
        % \item 8 min Lecture (4 frames): Expectation and variability
        % \item 8 min R Demo: Interpreting theoretical mean and variance (sample the card game RV, make a histogram of the samples, compare it to the discrete distribution, compute mean and variance of the samples, compare them to the theoretical mean and variance)
        % \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): Linear combinations
        % \item 3 min Edfinity quiz: Linear combinations
   \end{itemize}
