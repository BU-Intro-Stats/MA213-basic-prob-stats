    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO1: Classify and Analyze Variables:} Categorize variables based on their types (e.g., numerical/categorical, continuous/discrete, ordinal), assess their association (positive, negative, or independent), and determine which make sense as explanatory vs. response variables.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO2: Evaluate Study Design and Its Implications:} Identify and explain experimental design choices (observational vs. experimental, sampling methods, blinding, potential biases), and judge whether results can be generalized to a population or used to infer causation. 
    \end{itemize}
