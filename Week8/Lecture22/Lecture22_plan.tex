    \begin{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: recap comparing two proportions (CIs and HTs)
        \item xx min Lecture: new topic, introduce/motivate chi-squared tests
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: basically slides 7-8 (practice setting hypotheses)
        \item xx min Lecture/board work: derive(?) chi-square statistic, chi-squared distribution
        \item xx min R Demonstration: show and interpret some examples of chi-squared tests of GOF (and/or something like slides 15-18)
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: putting chi-squared GOF tests into practice (like slides 22, 26-29)
    \end{itemize}
