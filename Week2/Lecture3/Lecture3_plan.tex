    \begin{itemize}
        \item 6 min Lecture (6 slides): Sampling (left over from Lecture 2)
        \item 8 min Think/pair/share: sampling, bias concepts (left over from Lecture 2)
        \item 8 min Lecture (5 frames): experimental design
        \item 5 min Edfinity quiz: Experimental design
        \item 10 min Lecture (11 frames): Plotting data, means
        \item 8 min R demonstration: histograms and central tendency
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  highlight: distribution mean/median/mode, (multi)modality, skewness, outliers
        \end{itemize}

        % ------ (Decided not to do these) --------
        % \item 5 min Edfinity quiz (what kind of shapes do you expect these data to have...)
        % \item 3 min R demonstration: quiz answer(s)
        % \item 3 min: Youtube video from Nat Geo (?)
        % \item 8 min: Think/pair/share on the Youtube video

        % ------ Good place to stop --------
        % \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): variance, stddev, Q1 Q3 IQR
        % \item 4 min R demonstration: Comparing shapes of distributions with different summary statistics (eg. changing variance, etc.)
        % \begin{itemize}
        %     \item Highlight: variance/std and IQR
        %     \item Mean +/- 2 stddev lines above histogram
        %     \item Box with no whiskers above histogram to visualize quartiles and motivate box plot
        %  \end{itemize}
