    \begin{itemize}
        % ---------- From Lecture 17 ----------
        \item 4 min Lecture: Recap Confidence Intervals
        \item 5 min R demonstration: simulate running the experiment many times, get different answers for the CI, 95\% contain true
        \item 4 min Lecture: Confidence level
        \item 3 min R demonstration: effect of confidence level (using the same shiny app -- use a much lower CI and show that CIs are smaller but wrong more often)
        \item 4 min Edfinity Quiz
    
        % ---------- New for Lecture 18 ----------
        \item xx min Lecture: Motivate hypothesis tests / reminder of example from Lecture 5
        \item xx min Lecture: Hypothesis testing framework
        \item xx min Lecture: Tying in confidence intervals
        \item xx min R Demo: Experiments (show that sometimes you get the wrong answer with a HT)
        \item xx min Lecture: Decision errors, error table
        
        % ---------- (maybe) ----------
        \item xx min Lecture: Type 1 error rate, significance level
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: Significance levels

% TODO: R demo on using CIs to do HTs
% TODO: Edfinity quiz or think/pair/share on how confidence level would affect HT
% TODO: R demo on decision errors (now that we've defined them), computing error rates (?)
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on decision errors, HT Concept check
