\subsection{Expectation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Expectation}

\begin{itemize}

\item We are often interested in the average outcome of a random variable.

\item We call this the \hl{expected value} (mean), and it is a weighted average of the possible outcomes
\formula{\[\mu = E(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^k x_i ~ P(X = x_i)\]}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Expected value of a discrete random variable}

\dq{In a game of cards you win \$1 if you draw a heart, \$5 if you draw an ace (including the ace of hearts), \$10 if you draw the king of spades and nothing for any other card you draw. Write the probability model for your winnings, and calculate your expected winning.}

\subsection{Variability in random variables}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variability}

We are also often interested in the variability in the values of a random variable.

\formula{
\[ \sigma^2 = Var(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^k (x_i - E(X))^2 P(X = x_i) \]
\[ \sigma = SD(X) = \sqrt{Var(X)} \]
}

\subsection{Linear combinations of random variables}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Linear combinations}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \hl{linear combination} of random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by

\[ aX + bY \]

where $a$ and $b$ are some fixed numbers.

\pause

\item The average value of a linear combination of random variables is given by
\formula{\[ E(aX + bY) = a \times E(X) + b \times E(Y) \]}

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Calculating the expectation of a linear combination}

\dq{On average, a statistics homework has 20.3 problems and a physics homework has 5.4 problems. You take 5 minutes for each statistics problem and 25 minutes for each physics problem. On average, how much time should you expect to spend on homework every week?}

\pause
Let $S$ be the number of statistics problems and $P$ be the number of physics problems. 
\begin{align*} 
E(5S+25P) &= 5 \times E(S) + 25 \times E(P) \\
&= 5 \times 20.3 + 25 \times 5.4 \\

\subsection{Variability in linear combinations of random variables}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Linear combinations}

\begin{itemize}

\item The variability of a linear combination of two independent random variables is calculated as
\formula{\[ V(aX + bY) = a^2 \times V(X) + b^2 \times V(Y) \]}

\pause 

\item The standard deviation of the linear combination is the square root of the variance.

\end{itemize}

\pause 
\vfill

\Note{If the random variables are not independent, the variance calculation gets a little more complicated and is beyond the scope of this course.}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Calculating the variance of a linear combination}

\dq{The standard deviation of the number of statistics problems per homework is 2.3 problems, and it is 0.5 problems for physics homeworks. What is the standard deviation of the time you expect to spend on homework for the week? Assume that the number of problems on your statistics homework is independent of the number of problems on your physics homework.}

\soln{
\pause
\begin{align*} 
V(5S+25P) &= V(5S) + V(25P) \\

The standard deviation is $\sqrt{288.5} = 16.99~min = 0.28~hours$

\section{Continuous distributions}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Continuous distributions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Below is a histogram of the distribution of heights of US adults. 

\item The proportion of data that falls in the shaded bins gives the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm (about 5'11" to 6'1").

\end{itemize}

\subsection{From histograms to continuous distributions}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{From histograms to continuous distributions}

Since height is a continuous numerical variable, its \hl{probability density function} is a smooth curve.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Probabilities from continuous distributions}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Probabilities from continuous distributions}

Therefore, the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm can also be estimated as the shaded area under the curve.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{By definition...}

Since continuous probabilities are estimated as ``the area under the curve", the probability of a person being exactly 180 cm (or any exact value) is defined as 0.
