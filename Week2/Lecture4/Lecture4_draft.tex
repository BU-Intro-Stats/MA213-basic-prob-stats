\frametitle{Box plot}

The box in a \hl{box plot} represents the middle 50\% of the data, and the thick line in the box is the median.

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Whiskers} of a box plot can extend up to $1.5 \times IQR$ away from the quartiles.
\formula{
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{align*} 
\text{max~upper~whisker~reach} &= Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR \\
\text{max~lower~whisker~reach} &= Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR

\end{align*}
}

\pause
\vspace{-0.25cm}
\item A potential \hl{outlier} is defined as an observation beyond the maximum reach of the whiskers. It is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Robust statistics}

Median and IQR are more robust to skewness and outliers than mean and SD. Therefore,

\begin{itemize}
\item for skewed distributions it is often more helpful to use median and IQR to describe the center and spread
\item for symmetric distributions it is often more helpful to use the mean and SD to describe the center and spread
\end{itemize}

\item If the distribution is skewed or has extreme outliers, center is often defined as the median

\item Right-skewed: mean $>$ median
\item Left-skewed: mean $<$ median \\

\subsection{Transforming data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Extremely skewed data}

When data are extremely skewed, transforming them might make modeling easier. A common transformation is the \hl{log transformation}.

$\:$ \\
\pause
The histograms on the left shows the distribution of number of basketball games attended by students. The histogram on the right shows the distribution of log of number of games attended.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\chpii@path/2-1_numerical_data/figures/basket_games/basket_games_hist}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\chpii@path/2-1_numerical_data/figures/basket_games/basket_games_hist_log}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Pros and cons of transformations}

\begin{itemize}

\item Skewed data are easier to model with when they are transformed because outliers tend to become far less prominent after an appropriate transformation. \\
$\:$ \\
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r }
\# of games		&  70 	& 50 		& 25 		 		& $\cdots$ \\
log(\# of games)	& 4.25	& 3.91 	& 3.22 	 	& $\cdots$
\end{tabular}

$\:$ \\

\item However, results of an analysis in log units of the measured variable might be difficult to interpret.

\end{itemize}

\section{Considering categorical data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Contingency tables and bar plots}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Contingency tables}

A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables is called a \hl{contingency table}.

$\:$ \\
\pause
The contingency table below shows the distribution of survival and ages of passengers on the Titanic.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l cc r}
					               & 			 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{{Survival}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
					               &			 & Died	 & Survived	& Total \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{{Age}}& Adult & 1438  & 654 	  	& 2092 \\ 
  					             & Child & 52 	 & 57	 	    & 109\\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  					             & Total & 1490  & 711	    &  2201 \\
  \cline{2-5}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bar plots}

A \hl{bar plot} is a common way to display a single categorical variable. A bar plot where proportions instead of frequencies are shown is called a \hl{relative frequency bar plot}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{\chpii@path/2-2_categorical_data/figures/titanic_age_survival/titanic_bar}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{\chpii@path/2-2_categorical_data/figures/titanic_age_survival/titanic_rel_bar}
\end{center}

\pause

\dq{How are bar plots different than histograms?}

\soln{\pause{{\tiny Bar plots are used for displaying distributions of categorical variables,  histograms are used for numerical variables. The x-axis in a histogram is a number line,  hence the order of the bars cannot be changed. In a bar plot, the categories can be listed in any order (though some orderings make more sense than others, especially for ordinal variables.)}}}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Row and column proportions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Choosing the appropriate proportion}

\dq{Does there appear to be a relationship between age and survival for passengers on the Titanic?}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l cc r}
					               & 			 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{{Survival}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
					               &			 & Died	 & Survived	& Total \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{{Age}}& Adult & 1438  & 654 	  	& 2092 \\ 
  					             & Child & 52 	 & 57	 	    & 109\\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  					             & Total & 1490  & 711	    &  2201 \\
  \cline{2-5}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause

To answer this question we examine the row proportions: 

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item \% Adults who survived: 654 / 2092 $\approx 0.31$ \\

\pause

\item \% Children who survived: 57 / 109 $\approx 0.52$ \\

\end{itemize}
