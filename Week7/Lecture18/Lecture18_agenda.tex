    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M3 LO3: Calculate and Interpret Standard Error:} Calculate the standard error for proportions and interpret it as a measure of sampling variability.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO4: Explain Hypothesis Testing and Its Limitations:} Discuss the use cases and potential issues with hypothesis testing, including the interpretation of results.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO5: Understand Errors and Significance Levels:} Identify Type I and Type II errors and explain how they are influenced by changes in the significance level.
    \end{itemize}
