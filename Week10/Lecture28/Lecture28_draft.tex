	\frametitle{What was the standard error of the test statistic $\hat{d}$?}

	\vspace{0.5em}
	\begin{align*}
	&\textbf{p-value:}\quad \Pr(|d| > \hat{d}\mid H_0) = 0.015 \\
	&\Pr(d > \hat{d}\mid H_0) = \frac{0.015}{2} = 0.0075 \\
	&\frac{\hat{d} - 0}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{d}}} = Z \sim N(0,1) \\
	&\Pr\left(Z > \frac{\hat{d}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{d}}} \mid H_0\right) = 0.0075
	\end{align*}

	Using R, $\Pr(Z > 2.4) = 0.0075$

	\begin{align*}
	\frac{\hat{d}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{d}}} = 2.4 \implies \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{d}} = \frac{8}{2.4} = \textcolor{red}{3.3\%}

\section{Takeaways and Best Practices}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Takeaways}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Even if your sample size looks large, your power could be low if the population standard deviation is large or the effect size is small
		\item If your power is low and you reject the null hypothesis
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There is a high probability that your estimated effect is in the wrong direction (Sign Error)
			\item There is a high probability that your estimated effect is larger than any actual effect (Magnitude Error)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Best Practices}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To avoid sign and magnitude errors, be sure to calculate power using a realistic effect size and only report results when power $>0.8$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Never calculate power based on the effect size from the current experiment
			\item Avoid basing the effect size on prior studies with low power (due to small sample size or high standard deviation)
			\item Ideally, base it on prior studies with high power (even if the question of interest was different)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Consider power when designing studies and interpreting results
