\subsection{Multiple comparisons \& Type 1 error rate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Which means differ?}

\begin{itemize}

\item Earlier we concluded that at least one pair of means differ. The natural question that follows is ``which ones?"

\pause

\item We can do two sample $t$ tests for differences in each possible pair of groups.

\pause

\end{itemize}

\dq{Can you see any pitfalls with this approach?}

% \pause

% \begin{itemize}

% \item When we run too many tests, the Type 1 Error rate increases.

% \item This issue is resolved by using a modified significance level.

% \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multiple comparisons}

\begin{itemize}

\item The scenario of testing many pairs of groups is called \hl{multiple comparisons}.

\pause

\item The \hl{Bonferroni correction} suggests that a more \orange{stringent} significance level is more appropriate for these tests:

\[ \alpha^\star = \alpha / K \]

where $K$ is the number of comparisons being considered.

\pause

\item If there are $k$ groups, then usually all possible pairs are compared and $K = \frac{k (k - 1)}{2}$.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Determining the modified $\alpha$}

\pq{In the aldrin data set depth has 3 levels: bottom, mid-depth, and surface. If $\alpha = 0.05$, what should be the modified significance level for two sample $t$ tests for determining which pairs of groups have significantly different means?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\alpha^* = 0.05$
\item $\alpha^* = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025$
\solnMult{$\alpha^* = 0.05 / 3 = 0.0167$}
\item $\alpha^* = 0.05 / 6 = 0.0083$
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Which means differ?}

\pq{Based on the box plots below, which means would you expect to be significantly different?}

\item bottom \& surface
\item bottom \& mid-depth

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Which means differ? (cont.)}

If the ANOVA assumption of equal variability across groups is satisfied, we can use the data from all groups to estimate variability:
    
\begin{itemize}

\item Estimate any within-group standard deviation with $\sqrt{MSE}$, which is $s_{pooled}$

\item Use the error degrees of freedom, $n - k$, for $t$-distributions

\end{itemize}

\formula{Difference in two means: after ANOVA}{
\[ SE = \sqrt{  \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2} } \approx \sqrt{ \frac{MSE}{n_1} + \frac{MSE}{n_2} } \]
}
