\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualize and Interpret Sampling Distributions: Draw and interpret sampling distributions for a point estimate (e.g., population proportion) across different sample sizes, explaining how the distribution changes as the sample size increases. [Q3, L4] 
    \item Calculate and Interpret Standard Error: Calculate the standard error for proportions and interpret it as a measure of sampling variability. [Q3, L4]
\end{itemize}
