In this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.

The \hl{scatterplot} below shows the relationship between HS graduate rate in all 50 US states and DC and the \% of residents who live below the poverty line {\small (income below \$23,050 for a family of 4 in 2012)}.

\subsection{Using a linear regression to predict poverty}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

The linear model for predicting poverty from high school graduation rate in the US is

\[ \hat{poverty} = 64.78 - 0.62 * HS_{grad} \]

The ``hat" is used to signify that this is an estimate.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\dq{The high school graduate rate in Georgia is 85.1\%. What poverty level does the model predict for this state?}

\pause

\[ 64.78 - 0.62 * 85.1 = 12.018 \]

\end{frame}

\hl{Residuals} are the leftovers from the model fit: Data = Fit + Residual

Residual is the difference between the observed ($y_i$) and predicted $\hat{y}_i$.

\subsection{Describing linear relationships with correlation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Quantifying the relationship}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Correlation} describes the strength of the \orange{linear} association between two variables.

\pause

\item It takes values between -1 (perfect negative) and +1 (perfect positive).

\pause

\item A value of 0 indicates no linear association.

\end{itemize}
