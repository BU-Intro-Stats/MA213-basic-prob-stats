\section{Review: Inference for one proportion}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{6.1 Inference for a single proportion}
We used inference for a single proportion in Chapter 5 to motivate confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.

Chapter 6.1 provides a review of inference for a single proportion, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sampling distribution of the sample proportion
        \item Confidence intervals for a single proportion
        \item Hypothesis tests for a single proportion
        \item (New) Choosing a sample size for a desired margin of error
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}\)}

The sampling distribution for \(\hat{p}\) based on a sample of size \(n\) from a population with true proportion \(p\) is nearly normal when:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The sample's observations are independent (e.g., from a simple random sample).
  \item We expect at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e. \(np \ge 10\) and \(n(1-p) \ge 10\) (the success-failure condition).
\end{enumerate}

When these conditions are met, \(\hat{p}\) is approximately normal with
\[ \hat{p} \sim Normal \pr{ mean = p, SE = \sqrt{\frac{p~(1-p)}{n}} } \]

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Confidence interval for a single proportion}

If a confidence interval is appropriate:

\begin{description}
  \item[\hl{Prepare.}] Identify $\hat{p}$ and $n$, and choose the confidence level (e.g. 95\%).
  \item[\hl{Check.}] Verify conditions for approximate normality: independence (random sample / 10\% rule) and success-failure. For confidence intervals use $\hat{p}$ in the success-failure check: $\;n\hat{p}\ge10\;$ and $\;n(1-\hat{p})\ge10$.
  \item[\hl{Calculate.}] Compute the standard error using $\hat{p}$ and find the critical value $z^\star$:
  \[
    SE(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\dfrac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}, \qquad
    \text{CI: }\hat{p}\pm z^\star \,SE(\hat{p}).
  \]
  \item[\hl{Conclude.}] Interpret the interval in context (what the confidence level means for the parameter).
\end{description}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hypothesis testing for a single proportion}

If a hypothesis test is appropriate:

\begin{small}
\begin{description}
  \item[\hl{Prepare.}] State the parameter, write $H_0$ and $H_A$ (one or two-sided), choose significance level $\alpha$, and record $\hat{p}$ and $n$.
  \item[\hl{Check.}] Verify independence (random sample / 10\% rule) and the success-failure condition \emph{using the null value} $p_0$: \[
    np_0 \ge 10 \quad\text{and}\quad n(1-p_0)\ge 10.
  \]
  \item[\hl{Calculate.}] Use $p_0$ to compute the standard error and then the Z statistic:
  \[
    SE = \sqrt{\dfrac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}, \qquad
    Z=\dfrac{\hat{p}-p_0}{SE}.
  \]
  Find the p-value corresponding to $Z$ (one- or two-sided).
  \item[\hl{Conclude.}] Compare the p-value to $\alpha$: reject $H_0$ if p-value $<\alpha$, otherwise fail to reject. State the result in context.
\end{description}
\end{small}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CI vs. HT for proportions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Success-failure condition:
\begin{itemize}
\item CI: At least 10 \orange{observed} successes and failures
\item HT: At least 10 \orange{expected} successes and failures, calculated using the null value
\end{itemize}

\item Standard error:
\begin{itemize}
\item CI: calculate using observed sample proportion: $SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$
\item HT: calculate using the null value: $SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}$
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Melting ice cap}

\pq{Scientists predict that global warming may have big effects on the polar regions within the next 100 years. One of the possible effects is that the northern ice cap may completely melt. Would this bother you a great deal, some, a little, or not at all if it actually happened?}

The GSS asks the same question, below are the distributions of responses from the 2010 GSS as well as from a group of introductory statistics students at Duke University: \\

\[ \mathhl{ p_{Duke} - p_{US} }\]

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conditions for CI for difference of proportions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hl{Independence within groups: }
\begin{itemize}
\item The US group is sampled randomly and we're assuming that the Duke group represents a random sample as well.
\pause
\item 105 $<$ 10\% of all Duke students and 680 $<$ 10\% of all Americans.
\end{itemize}
\pause
We can assume that the attitudes of Duke students in the sample are independent of each other, and attitudes of US residents in the sample are independent of each other as well.

\pause

\item \hl{Independence between groups: }
The sampled Duke students and the US residents are independent of each other.

\pause

\item \hl{Success-failure:} \\
At least 10 observed successes and 10 observed failures in the two groups.

\begin{frame}{Comparing Two Online Ads: Small Study}
\small
Imagine a company tests two versions of an online ad by showing each to 10{,}000 users.

\medskip
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{4pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.1}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\textbf{Ad} & Clicked & Total & \(\hat p\) \\
\hline
A & 510 & 10{,}000 & 0.051 \\
B & 550 & 10{,}000 & 0.055 \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip
\[
\hat{p}_B - \hat{p}_A = 0.004
\]

\[
SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.051(1-0.051)}{10{,}000} + \frac{0.055(1-0.055)}{10{,}000}} \approx 0.0031
\]

\[
95\%~CI = 0.004 \pm 1.96(0.0031) = (-0.002,\, 0.010)
\]

\textbf{Interpretation:} The interval includes 0, so we \textbf{do not have statistical evidence}
that Ad B performs better than Ad A.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Comparing Two Online Ads: Large Study}
\small
Now imagine they did the same thing, but each ad shown to 1{,}000{,}000 users. And they observed the same proportions (5.1\% vs 5.5\%).

\medskip
\[
SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.051(1-0.051)}{1{,}000{,}000} + \frac{0.055(1-0.055)}{1{,}000{,}000}}
      \approx 0.00031
\]
\[
95\%~CI = 0.004 \pm 1.96(0.00031) = (0.0034,\, 0.0046)
\]

\textbf{Interpretation:} The interval no longer includes 0.  
The difference is \textbf{statistically significant.}

\medskip
\textbf{But...} the effect size is only \(\mathbf{0.004}\) (0.4 percentage points) --  
does that matter in practice?
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Statistical vs.\ Practical Significance}
\small
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Sample Size} & \textbf{95\% CI} & \textbf{Stat.\ Sig.?} \\
\hline
Small study & 10{,}000 per ad & (-0.002,\; 0.010) & No \\
Large study & 1{,}000{,}000 per ad & (0.0034,\; 0.0046) & Yes \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\medskip
\textbf{Takeaways:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Statistical significance depends on both \hl{effect size} and \hl{sample size}.
  \item Practical significance depends on whether the effect is \hl{large enough to matter}.
  \item With large enough data, even tiny effects can be statistically significant.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\textit{Statistical significance tells you it's unlikely to be due to chance.  \\
Practical significance tells you if it matters.}

\begin{itemize}
\item independence within groups \\

\item independence between groups
\item at least 10 successes and failures in each group\\

\item for CI: use $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$

\begin{itemize}
\item when $H_0: p_1 = p_2$: use $\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\#~suc_1 + \#suc_2}{n_1 + n_2}$
