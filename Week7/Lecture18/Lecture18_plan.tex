    \begin{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: Motivate hypothesis tests / reminder of example from Lecture 5
        \item xx min Lecture: Hypothesis testing framework
        \item xx min Lecture: Tying in confidence intervals
        \item xx min R Demo: Experiments (e.g. show that sometimes you get the wrong answer with a HT)
        \item xx min Edfinity Quiz or think/pair/share (e.g. how would a different confidence level affect the hypothesis test?)
        \item xx min Lecture: Decision errors, error table
        \item xx min R Demonstration: examples of hypothesis tests and decision errors
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Highlight: an error that might be easy to make in their own work
        \end{enumerate}
        \item xx min R Demonstration: computing error rates
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: decision errors, HT concept check
        \item xx min Lecture: introduce test statistics (to be continued next time)

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M3, LO4: Explain Hypothesis Testing and Its Limitations:} Discuss the use cases and potential issues with hypothesis testing, including the interpretation of results.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO5: Understand Errors and Significance Levels:} Identify Type I and Type II errors and explain how they are influenced by changes in the significance level.
        \item \textbf{M4, LO2: Design and Interpret Confidence Intervals:} Design, execute, and interpret confidence intervals for the population proportion.
        \item \textbf{M4, LO3: Conduct and Interpret Hypothesis Tests for Proportions:} Design, execute, and interpret hypothesis tests for population proportions.

% TODO: R demo on using CIs to do HTs
% TODO: Edfinity quiz or think/pair/share on how confidence level would affect HT
% TODO: Review use of the word "p-value" before it is defined -- either change the wording or define it earlier
% TODO: R demo on decision errors (now that we've defined them), computing error rates (?)
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on decision errors, HT Concept check
