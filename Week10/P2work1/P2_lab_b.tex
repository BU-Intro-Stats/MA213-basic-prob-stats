\subsection*{1. Check-in and Progress Sharing}
Each group member briefly shares progress since the last lab:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data collection and cleaning status  
    \item Preliminary analysis and visualizations completed  
    \item Any interesting patterns or initial findings  
    \item Problems or challenges encountered  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Review and Discussion of Preliminary Results}
Discuss your group's current results and analyses:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are the descriptive statistics and visualizations clear and informative?  
    \item Do the initial hypothesis tests make sense?  
    \item Is the data quality sufficient for your analysis?
