# **Lab 1b: Introduction to R continued**

In this lab session, we will continue to learn basic syntax of R and how to use R for exploratory data analyses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Learning Objectives

-   Use R for Data Management and Exploration: Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
-   Data Handling and Preprocessing: I can use R to load, clean, and preprocess real-world data sets, applying techniques such as handling missing values, transforming variables, and merging data sources.
-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization. I can conduct exploratory data analysis in R, creating appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) and summary statistics to uncover data patterns and inform subsequent analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pre-lab activities

-   We are going to work in groups. Let’s form pairs. You can discuss the exercise questions and post-lab activities with your members.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
num_ppl_each_group = 2
student_list <- read.csv("StudentList.csv")
N <- nrow(student_list)

# Sort by last name
student_list <- student_list %>% arrange(Last)
student_list$number <- 1:N

# Shuffle the student numbers randomly
shuffled <- sample(student_list$number)

# Create group
group_ids <- rep(1:ceiling(N / num_ppl_each_group), num_ppl_each_group)[1:N]

# Assign data frame
group_df <- data.frame(number = shuffled, group = group_ids)
grouped_students <- left_join(group_df, student_list, by = "number")

grouped_students <- grouped_students %>% arrange(group)

# Output
grouped_students %>% select(!number)
```

## Lab activities

In this lab, we are going to go over New York air quality data.

The following is the description of the data.

## **New York Air Quality Data**

> Description :
>
> Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973 stored within a data frame with 153 observations on 6 variables. It is obtained from the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data). It is cited by @chambers2018graphical.

## Loading some packages for plotting and summaries.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2) # library for plotting 

library(dplyr) # library for data wrangling 
library(tidyr)
```

## Some useful functions to check the data

> `head(df)`: Displays the first six rows of the data frame.
>
> `tail(df)`: Displays the last six rows of the data frame.
>
> `str(df)`: Shows the structure of the data frame, including column types and sample values.
>
> `dplyr::glimpse(df)`: Provides a transposed, compact view of the data frame, making it easier to read.

## Checking missing values

> `is.na(df)`: Returns a logical values indicating missing (`NA`) values in the data frame.
>
> `na.omit(df)`: Removes rows with missing values (`NA`s) from the data frame.
>
> `unique(x)` : Returns a vector, data frame or array like x but with duplicate elements/rows removed.

## Import Airquality Data

You can use `airquality` object from base R data. You can also `airquality.csv` file where the data is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file. Each row holds information for a single observation.

Import the data from `airquality.csv` and show first 6 rows to see how this data is organized.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df = read.csv("airquality.csv")
head(df) 
```

## `glimpse` function in dplyr package

```{r, echo=TRUE}

dplyr::glimpse(df)

```

## Let's check if we have a missing value in the data.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(is.na(df))

```

## Let's work without missing value this time.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

df_filtered <- na.omit(df)
head(df_filtered)


```

## \* `tidyverse` package

`tidyverse` is a collection of R packages that includes famous data manipulation package `dplyr`, powerful data visualization package `ggplot2` (<https://github.com/tidyverse>).

## Data wrangling using `dplyr` package

> `%>%` : pipes operator
>
> It takes the output of the expression on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right (it works like "`and then"` in English).
>
> We are briefly going over some basic functionalists in `dplyr` packages.

## Functions in `dplyr` package

> `select()` : Select columns from a data frame
>
> `filter()` : Filter rows based on conditions `mutate()` : Create or modify columns
>
> `group_by()` : Group data for aggregation (Groups data based on one or more variables)
>
> `summarise()` : Summarize data (Reduces data to summary statistics, like mean, sum, count, etc)

## `Dplyr` Examples 1

If you want `Ozone`, `Temp` and `Month` columns only from the data

```{r, echo=TRUE}

df_filtered %>%
  select(Ozone, Temp, Month)


```

## `Dplyr` Examples 2

You want only May data only

```{r, echo=TRUE}

df_filtered %>% 
  select_all() %>%
  filter(Month == 5)
  


```

## `Dplyr` Examples 3

You want the temperature in Celsius.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

df_filtered %>%
  mutate(Temp_C = (Temp-32)*(5/9))


```

## `Dplyr` Examples 4

You want to see the average temperature by Month in Celsius.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df_filtered %>%
  mutate(Temp_C = (Temp-32)*(5/9)) %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(avg_temp_C = mean(Temp_C))

```

## Graphics with `ggplot2` package

Plotting with `ggplot2` package begins with

`ggplot(data = df, aes(x=x_xvariable, y=y_variable))`

where

`df` : your dataframe name,

`aes()` : Aesthetics to define -\> specifying which variables are mapped to the x and y axes.

## `geoms` functions

and then you add `geoms` functions – geometrical objects as a graphical representation of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). **`ggplot2`** offers many different geoms; We will use a few common ones today, including:

-   `geom_point()` : scatter plots, dot plots, etc.

-   `geom_line()` : trend lines, time-series, etc.

-   `geom_histogram()` : histograms

## Structure of `ggplot`

In short,

[![ggplot function overview (\<https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf\> )](ggplot.jpg)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf)

## ggplot example

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# ggplot version
ggplot(data=df_filtered, mapping=aes(x=Ozone, y=Temp)) + 
  geom_point()


```

## Numerical Data Analysis

We want to examine the shape of `Ozone` to see whether the data is symmetric, skewed or how the mean is centered and so on. Let's see how this `Ozone` data is shaped by using several different methods.

## 1. Summary of `Ozone`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

summary(df_filtered$Ozone)
```

## 2. Dot plot of `Ozone`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

stripchart(df_filtered$Ozone)

```

## 3. Stacked dot plot of `Ozone` .

```{r, echo=TRUE}

stripchart(df_filtered$Ozone, method = "stack")
# add a mean point 
mean_ozone <- mean(df_filtered$Ozone)
points(mean_ozone, 1, col="red", pch=19, cex = 1.5)

```

## Stacked dot plot with median point

```{r, echo=TRUE}

stripchart(df_filtered$Ozone, method = "stack")
# add a median point 
median_ozone <- median(df_filtered$Ozone)
points(median_ozone, 1, col="red", pch=19, cex = 1.5)

```

## Stacked dot plot ggplot2 version

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = df_filtered, aes(Ozone)) + 
  geom_dotplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_ozone, color="red")

```

## 4. Box plot of `Ozone`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(df_filtered$Ozone)

```

## Box plot ggplot2 version

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=df_filtered, aes(Ozone)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

## 5. Histogram of `Ozone` .

```{r, echo=TRUE}

hist(df_filtered$Ozone)

```

## Histogram ggplot2 version

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# ggplot version

ggplot(data=df_filtered ) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(Ozone), binwidth = 5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_ozone, color = "red") 
  

```

## 6. Histogram of `Ozone` with different bins/breaks to show more information.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

hist(df_filtered$Ozone, breaks=30)


```

## Histogram ggplot2 version with different bin option

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# ggplot version

ggplot(data=df_filtered ) + geom_histogram(aes(Ozone), bins = 5)


ggplot(data=df_filtered, aes(Ozone)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) 

# breaks in hist() and bins in geom_histogra() works differently 
```

## labels in ggplot

```{r, echo=TRUE}



ggplot(data=df_filtered, aes(Ozone)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color='yellow') +
  labs(x='Ozone Level', title = 'Histogram with 30 bins')


```

## 7. Scatter plot of `Ozone` and `Temp` .

We want to examine whether there is a relationship between ozone and temperature. How do we want to approach this?

```{r, echo=TRUE}

plot(df_filtered$Temp, df_filtered$Ozone)

```

## ggplot version

```{r, echo=TRUE}

ggplot(df_filtered) + geom_point(aes(x=Ozone, y=Temp)) + 
  labs(title='Scatter plot of Ozone vs Temperature')


```

### Exercise

#### Q. Let’s talk about the variables in the data. What is numerical data, and what is categorical data? Can we also identify variables of interest and discuss possible hypotheses?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(df_filtered)

help("airquality") # You can access the documentation of the data using help() function 
```

#### Q. You are interested in Ozone level excluding May. You want to see how Ozone level is distributed in June, July, August and September by looking at some plots.

```{r}
#
#
```

#### Q. You want to see how average speed of wind changes over time (Month). Can you visualize it?

```{r}
#
#
```

#### Q. Do you see any patterns of level of Ozone over time?

```{r}
#
#
```

### Post-lab activities

Please name your submission as `lab1b.R`

We are going to analyze this New York Air Quality Measurements data again. This time, we are going to see how Solar radiation is behaving in terms of Temperature.

We are going to work without missing values again.

0.  load the `airquality.csv` file and assign it to `my_df` object. And assign the data without missing value to `new_df`

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    my_df <- read.csv("airquality.csv")
    # new_df <- ?
    ```

1.  How many observations are in the data without missing value? In other words, how many rows in the data without missing value? Assign it to `n`

2.  What is the maximum daily temperature at LaGuardia airport? Assign it to `max_temp`

3.  What is the third quantile of `Solar.R` ? Assign it to `third_q`

4.  You are interested in the median value of `wind` in August. Assign the value to `median_august_wind`
