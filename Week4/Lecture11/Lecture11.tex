\begin{itemize}

\item For nearly normally distributed data, 
\begin{itemize}
\item about 68\% falls within 1 SD of the mean,
\item about 95\% falls within 2 SD of the mean,
\item about 99.7\% falls within 3 SD of the mean.
\end{itemize}

\item It is possible for observations to fall 4, 5, or more standard deviations away from the mean, but these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal.

\end{itemize}

SAT scores are distributed nearly normally with mean 1500 and standard deviation 300.

\pause
\begin{itemize}

\item $\sim$68\% of students score between 1200 and 1800 on the SAT. 

\item $\sim$95\% of students score between 900 and 2100 on the SAT. 

\item $\sim$99.7\% of students score between 600 and 2400 on the SAT.

% \pq{Which of the following is \underline{false}?}

% \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
% \item Majority of Z scores in a right skewed distribution are negative.
% \solnMult{In skewed distributions the Z score of the mean might be different than 0.}
% \item For a normal distribution, IQR is less than $2 \times SD$.
% \item Z scores are helpful for determining how unusual a data point is compared to the rest of the data in the distribution.
