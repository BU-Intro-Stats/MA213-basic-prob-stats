    \begin{itemize}
        \item 5 min Lecture: recap inference for one proportion, motivate difference of two proportions
        \item xx min Lecture: difference of proportions CIs
        \item xx min R Demonstration: examples - how does the sample size affect inference this time? (for CIs)
        \item xx min Lecture: difference of proportions for HTs
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: experimental design, null/alternative hypotheses examples
        \item xx min Lecture: review quiz answers
        \item xx min Lecture: pooled proportion
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: Computing test statistic for H0:p1=p2
