    \begin{itemize}
        \item 6 min Lecture (5 frames): Sampling from a small population
        \item 4 min Edfinity Quiz: Sampling with/without replacement
        % \item 4 min R Demonstration: Sampling with and without replacement in R (use it for a LLN refresher demo?)
        \item 4 min Lecture (3 frames): Random variables and Discrete probability distributions
        \item 4 min Edfinity Quiz: (3 multiple choice subquestions: Identifying Discrete Probability Distributions as Table, Bar plot, Formula)
        \item 8 min Lecture + Board work (4 frames): Expectation and variability
        \item 5 min Edfinity Quiz: computing expectation and Variance
        \item 4 min Board work: Quiz solutions
        \item 8 min R Demo: Interpreting theoretical mean and variance (sample the card game RV, make a histogram of the samples, compare it to the discrete distribution, compute mean and variance of the samples, compare them to the theoretical mean and variance)
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): Linear combinations
        \item 3 min Edfinity quiz: Linear combinations
   \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M2, LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
        \item \textbf{M2, LO3: Compute Probabilities Using Various Tools:} Use logic, Venn diagrams, and probability rules to compute probabilities for events.
        \item \textbf{M2, LO4: Understand and Compute Expectations and Variances:} Explain the concepts of expectations and variances of random variables, and compute the expectation and variance of a linear combination of random variables.
