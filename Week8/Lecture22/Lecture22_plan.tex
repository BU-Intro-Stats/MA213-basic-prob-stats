    \begin{itemize}
        % ES: We could leave out this recap / R demo if we are short on time
        \item xx min Lecture: recap pooled proportion
        \item xx min R Demonstration: examples comparing one/two proportion inference computations
        %%%
        \item xx min Lecture: new topic, introduce/motivate chi-squared tests
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: basically slides 7-8 (practice setting hypotheses)
        \item xx min Lecture/board work: derive(?) chi-square statistic, chi-squared distribution
        \item xx min R Demonstration: show and interpret some examples of chi-squared tests of GOF (and/or something like slides 15-18)
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: putting chi-squared GOF tests into practice (like slides 22, 26-29)
        % I like the idea of having a motivating example (Labby's dice here) to return to throughout the lecture,
        % if the dice are too simplistic/boring can also introduce the 2009 Iran election case study earlier
        % ES: I like the Iran election case! We could use it in the final quiz, and make it extended?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO3: Calculate and Interpret Standard Error:} Calculate the standard error for proportions and interpret it as a measure of sampling variability.
        \item \textbf{M4, LO2: Design and Interpret Confidence Intervals:} Design, execute, and interpret confidence intervals for the population proportion.
        \item \textbf{M4, LO3: Conduct and Interpret Hypothesis Tests for Proportions:} Design, execute, and interpret hypothesis tests for population proportions.
        \item \textbf{M4, LO4: Conduct and Interpret Chi-Square Tests:} Assess whether the conditions for a chi-square test (goodness of fit or independence) are met, and if so, design, execute, and interpret the test.
