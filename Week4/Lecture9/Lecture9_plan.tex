    \begin{itemize}
        % ---------- From Lecture 8 ----------
        \item 8 min Lecture (5 frames): Expectation and variability
        \item 8 min R Demo: Interpreting theoretical mean and variance (sample the card game RV, make a histogram of the samples, compare it to the discrete distribution, compute mean and variance of the samples, compare them to the theoretical mean and variance)
        \item 5 min Lecture (4 frames): Linear combinations
        \item 5 min Edfinity quiz: Linear combinations

        % ---------- New for Lecture 9 ----------
        \item 10 min Lecture(5 frames): RVs recap
        \item 8 min Think/Pair/Share: Derive mean and SD of the sample mean (give hints every 2 minutes)
        \item 6 min Board work: Derive mean and SD of the sample mean
        
        % ---------- ok if we don't get to this ----------
        \item 5 min Lecture (4 frames): Continuous distributions, probability density functions
        \item xx min R Demonstration: Continuous distribution examples
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: concepts
    \end{itemize}

% TODO: consider changing the numbers in the RVs review to make it easier for board work
% TODO: R demo on continuous distributions
    % Normalized Histogram of a continuous RV: increasing sample size, decreasing bin size
    % Plot continuous distribution on top
    % Point out / think/pair/share: probabilities are areas under the curve, total area is 1
    % Examples of different distributions (Normal, Exponential, Uniform, Bimodal mixture of Gaussians?)
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on continuous distributions
