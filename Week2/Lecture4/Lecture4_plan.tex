    \begin{itemize}
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): Box plot and outliers
        \item 4 min R demo: Box plots with whiskers, outliers (similar to R demo from Lecture 3)
        \item 3 min Edfinity quiz: Outliers -- example where the outlier is likely an error
        \item 5 min Forum brainstorm: what to do with outliers
        \item 1 min: Motivate Edfinity poll about robust statistics
        \item 5 min: Edfinity poll with applet
        \item 3 min Lecture (3 frames) Robust Statistics 
        \item 3 min: Edfinity quiz: Mean >< Median
        \item 2 min Lecture (3 frames): Transformations and intensity maps
        \item 8 min Lecture (8 frames): contingency tables
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz(zes) or another active learning (contingency tables, interpreting plots from examples)
        \item xx min Lecture: Set up problem for Case Study next lecture

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO1: Classify and Analyze Variables:} Categorize variables based on their types (e.g., numerical/categorical, continuous/discrete, ordinal), assess their association (positive, negative, or independent), and determine which make sense as explanatory vs. response variables.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO4: Visualize and Describe Data Distributions:} Select appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, histograms, box plots, bar plots) to depict data, and describe distributions qualitatively (shape, center, spread, outliers) and quantitatively (mean, median, mode, range, IQR, standard deviation).
    \end{itemize}

% TODO: Build R demo on Box plot with whiskers, outliers
% TODO: Design a quick Edfinity Quiz on outliers (consider borrowing from old MA213) 
    % i.e. look at a box plot, what are the potential outliers? 
    % If time, Consider having students discuss potential reasons for the outliers and what to do with them in the class forum
% TODO: add slide/discussion on what to do with outliers
% TODO: Edfinity poll on robust statistics: try to find an applet that shows how mean/median/stddev/IQR are affected by outliers, build poll
% TODO: Edfinity Quiz on Mean/median difference for a skewed distribution
% TODO: try to find interesting applets for categorical visualizations (bar plots, pie charts, contingency tables)
