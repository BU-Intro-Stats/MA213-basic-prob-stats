    \begin{itemize}
        % ---------- From Lecture 6 ----------
        \item 4 min Lecture (4 frames): independence
        \item 5 min Edfinity quiz (checking for independence)
        \item 2 min Lecture (3 frames): recap + putting everything together

        % ---------- New for Lecture 7----------
        \item 7 min Lecture (7 frames): Conditional, marginal, and joint probability
        \item 4 min Lecture (3 frames): General multiplication rule, independence and conditional probabilities
        \item 6 min Edfinity quiz (4 subquestions: Computing probabilities using table and checking for independence using the general multiplication rule: one is independent, one isn't)
        \item 4 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz
        \item 5 min Lecture + Board work (2 frames): inverting probabilities (Consider removing the tree diagram slide, doing it on the board)
        \item 4 min Edfinity quiz (1 subquestion: Computing probabilities with multiplication rule and inversion)
        \item 2 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz
        \item 4 min Lecture (2+ frames): Bayes' Theorem and the Law of Total Probability
        \item 6 min Edfinity quiz (2 subquestions: (1) Law of total probability (2) Bayes' Theorem)
        \item 4 min Board work: computing the solutions to the quiz
    \end{itemize}
