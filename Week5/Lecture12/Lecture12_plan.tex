% TODO: Edfintiy quiz on bernoulli RVs
% TODO: Prepare board work for derivation of the Geometric distribution (using commented slide)
% TODO: Add slide showing the pmf as a formula, table, and picture. Add slide with the pmf picture, with visual indicator of the mean and +/- 1 std, +/- 2 std
% TODO: Edfinity quiz word problem for Geometric pmf (e.g. die roll example from sommented slide)
% TODO: Add a slide setting up the problem of computing the expected value of the geometric, using a table as we did before (but truncated) as well as the formula (with infinite sum). Point out that it is a complicated infinite sum, so we will give them the answer.
% TODO: R demo on sampling from Geometric
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on mean and variability for geometric
