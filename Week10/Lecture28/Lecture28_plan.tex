    \begin{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: Scandals in social science related to overreliance on hypothesis tests
        \item xx min Lecture: Beauty and Sex Ratios
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: HT concepts (What is the probability of a Type 1 error, how to interpret a rejected hypothesis, statistical vs practical significance)
        \item xx min Board work: How big did the effect size have to be to reach significance?
        \item xx min Board work: How many subjects would be required to detect an effect of 1\%? 
        \item xx min Board work: What was the power of the test to detect an effect of 1\%?
        \item xx min Lecture: Sampling distributions under H0 and Ha
        \item xx min R Demo: Simulate realistic effect size of 1\%, simulate probability that a rejected HT is in the wrong direction
        \item xx min Lecture: Takeaways and best practices

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO1: Understand Point Estimates and Sampling Variability:} Define a sample statistic (point estimate) for a population parameter, and explain how it varies across different samples.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO3: Calculate and Interpret Standard Error:} Calculate the standard error for proportions and interpret it as a measure of sampling variability.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO4: Explain Hypothesis Testing and Its Limitations:} Discuss the use cases and potential issues with hypothesis testing, including the interpretation of results.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO6: Distinguish Statistical vs. Practical Significance:} Differentiate between statistical significance and practical significance, and explain the implications of each.
