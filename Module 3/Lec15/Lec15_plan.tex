\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand Point Estimates and Sampling Variability: Define a sample statistic (point estimate) for a population parameter, and explain how it varies across different samples. [Q3, L4] 
    \item Visualize and Interpret Sampling Distributions: Draw and interpret sampling distributions for a point estimate (e.g., population proportion) across different sample sizes, explaining how the distribution changes as the sample size increases. [Q3, L4] 
\end{itemize}
