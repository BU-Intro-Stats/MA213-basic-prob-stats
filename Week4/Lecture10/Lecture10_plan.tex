% TODO: Fill in planned durations

% TODO: R demo on continuous distributions
    % Normalized Histogram of a continuous RV: increasing sample size, decreasing bin size
    % Plot continuous distribution on top
    % Point out / think/pair/share: probabilities are areas under the curve, total area is 1
    % Examples of different distributions (Normal, Exponential, Uniform, Bimodal mixture of Gaussians?)
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on continuous distributions

% TODO: R demo on normal distribution
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on z scores and percentiles, using a table
% TODO: Make a slide for the Quality Control example that shows how to get the probability with a table
% TODO: R demo on computing probabilities with R
% TODO: Edfinity quiz / board work on cutoff points / geometric logic with the normal distribution (using symmetry and 1-x to compute probabilities using logic)
