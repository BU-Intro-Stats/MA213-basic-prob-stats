Please write the names of all your team members, INCLUDING YOURSELF, and rate the degree
to which each member fulfilled his/her responsibilities in completing the group assignments.
Use the following rating system:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label=\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{Excellent}: Consistently went above and beyond the call of duty, tutored teammates, carried more than his/her fair share of the load.
    \item \textbf{Very good}: Consistently did what he/she was supposed to do, was very well prepared and cooperative.
    \item \textbf{Satisfactory}: Usually did what he/she was supposed to do, was acceptably prepared and cooperative.
    \item \textbf{Ordinary}: Often did what he/she was supposed to do, was minimally prepared and cooperative.
    \item \textbf{Marginal}: Sometimes failed to show up or complete assignments, was rarely prepared.
    \item \textbf{Deficient}: Often failed to show up or complete assignments, was rarely prepared.
    \item \textbf{Unsatisfactory}: Consistently failed to show up or complete assignments, was unprepared.
    \item \textbf{Superficial}: Had practically no participation.
    \item \textbf{No show}: Had no participation at all.
\end{itemize}

These ratings should reflect each individual's level of participation and effort and sense of responsibility, not his or her academic ability.
